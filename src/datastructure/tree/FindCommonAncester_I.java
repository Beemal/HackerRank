	 * Solution: If this were a binary search tree, we could do a modified find
	 * on the two nodes and see where the paths diverge. Unfortunately, this is
	 * not a binary search tree, so we much try other approaches.
	 * 
	 * Attempt #1: If each node has a link to its parent, we could trace p and
	 * qâ€™s paths up until they intersect.
	 * 
	 * Attempt #2: Alternatively, you could follow a chain in which p and q are
	 * on the same side. That is, if p and q are both on the left of the node,
	 * branch left to look for the common ancestor. When p and q are no longer
	 * on the same side, you must have found the first common ancestor.
