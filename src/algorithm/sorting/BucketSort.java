	 * Understanding the common sorting algorithms is incredibly valuable, as
	 * many sorting or searching solutions require tweaks of known sorting
	 * algorithms. A good approach when you are given a question like this is to
	 * run through the different sorting algorithms and see if one applies
	 * particularly well.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Example: You have a very large array of ‘Person’ objects. Sort the people
	 * in increasing order of age. We’re given two interesting bits of knowledge
	 * here: (1) It’s a large array, so efficiency is very important. (2) We are
	 * sorting based on ages, so we know the values are in a small range. By
	 * scanning through the various sorting algorithms, we might notice that
	 * bucket sort would be a perfect candidate for this algorithm. In fact, we
	 * can make the buckets small (just 1 year each) and get O(n) running time.
	 * 
	 *

	/*
	 * Partition the array into a finite number of buckets, and then sort each
	 * bucket individually. This gives a time of O(n + m), where n is the number
	 * of items and m is the number of distinct items.
